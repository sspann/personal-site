# `personal-site`

My personal-site built with Aurelia. The purpose of the site is consolidate all of my personal information, social media accounts, resume, etc.

## Getting started

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment *>=4.0* with NPM 3.

From the project folder, execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to
build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally. 

To run the app execute the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This command starts the webpack development server that serves the build bundles.
You can now browse the the site at http://localhost:9000. Changes in the code
will automatically build and reload the app.
